    "# Construct a Biomedical Knowledge Graph withÂ NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a crucial tool for analyzing human language and transforming it into a form that computers can understand. In the biomedical field, NLP techniques can extract information from research papers, journals, and databases, and represent it as a structured knowledge graph. This representation offers a comprehensive view of the relationships and interactions between biomedical concepts, such as genes, diseases, drugs, and proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, a single research paper is used to demonstrate the steps involved in constructing a biomedical knowledge graph, including (a) reading a PDF document with OCR, (b) text preprocessing, (c) biomedical concept recognition and linking, (d) relation extraction, and (e) external database enrichment. The resulting graph is stored in Neo4j, a graph database that uses the labeled property graph model and the Cypher query language to provide a comprehensive and easily searchable view of biomedical concepts and their relationships. This knowledge graph can be used for further analysis and insights."

    "### 3. Biomedical Named Entity Linking (NEL)\n",
    "Named entity recognition (NER) is a key technique in NLP that identifies relevant entities or concepts in text. In the biomedical domain, for example, NER can detect genes, drugs, diseases, and other relevant concepts. An upgraded version of NER is named entity linking (NEL), which not only detects relevant concepts in text but also maps them to a target knowledge base. The primary reason for using NEL is to help deal with entity disambiguation and to enrich our graph model by fetching information from the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the NEL models available is BERN, a fine-tuned BioBert model with integrated NEL models that map concepts to biomedical knowledge bases such as MESH, CHEBI, OMIM, ENSEMBL, and others. BERN provides a free REST endpoint, making it easy to use without having to deal with installation and dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use BERN for biomedical NER visualization, but it does not always assign target knowledge base IDs to concepts. To overcome this limitation, we have prepared a script that first checks if a distinct ID is given for a concept and, if not, uses the entity name as the ID. Additionally, we compute the sha256 of the text of sentences to easily identify specific sentences during relation extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the use of NEL techniques and models such as BERN helps to accurately identify and link relevant concepts in text to a target knowledge base, leading to a more comprehensive and enriched analysis.\n",
