## Construct a Biomedical Knowledge Graph with NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a crucial tool for analyzing human language and transforming it into a form that computers can understand. In the biomedical field, NLP techniques can extract information from research papers, journals, and databases, and represent it as a structured knowledge graph. This representation offers a comprehensive view of the relationships and interactions between biomedical concepts, such as genes, diseases, drugs, and proteins.
